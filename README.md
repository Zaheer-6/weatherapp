WEATHER APP

To create a weather app that fetches and displays weather data based on user input or location, follow these steps:

**Objective:**

Develop a web page that retrieves weather information from a weather API and displays current weather conditions, temperature, and other relevant data based on user input.

**Problem Statement:**

Design and implement a web application that interacts with a weather API to dynamically fetch and present weather details for a specified location. Provide users with the ability to enter a location manually or use their current location for automatic data retrieval.

**Domain:**

Web Development, Weather Data Integration

**Programming Languages and Tools:**

- HTML (for structure)
- CSS (for styling and layout)
- JavaScript (for fetching data from API and displaying dynamic content)
- Weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap, Weatherstack, or similar)

**Conclusion:**

By leveraging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with a weather API, you can build a functional weather app that enhances user experience by providing real-time weather updates. This project not only strengthens your frontend development skills but also familiarizes you with integrating external APIs to create dynamic and interactive web applications.
